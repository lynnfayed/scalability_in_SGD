Course: Optimization for Machine Learning 
Mini project title: Assessment of the Generalization Error of SGD in
Deep Neural Network
Authors: Fayed Lynn and Maljkovic Marko



#----- Running the code -----

All the code used to generate the results presented in the project report has been merged into a single jupyter notebook 'SGD_main.ipynb'.

Different steps that we analyze are placed into separate cells. These cells should be executed in order they are given in the notebook.

#----- Libraries used -----

The first cell in 'SGD_main.ipynb' imports all the neccessary libraries.

To run the code, it is important to have installed:

- pytorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- tikzplotlib
- numpy
